### 2. Replace `index.html`  
- Replace with `index_500mb.html` ‚Üí rename to `index.html`
- **Key Change**: `<p class="file-info">Supports .pptx files up to 500MB</p>`

### 3. Replace `manifest.json`
- Replace with `manifest_500mb.json` ‚Üí rename to `manifest.json`
- **Key Changes**: 
  - Version bumped to `"version": "1.2"`
  - Description updated to mention 500MB limit

## ‚ú® Performance Enhancements for Large Files

### Memory Management
- **Enhanced cleanup**: Proper blob URL management for large files
- **Progressive processing**: Better memory allocation during file processing
- **Optimized JSZip options**: Skip CRC checks for files over 100MB for faster processing

### User Experience
- **Large file detection**: Special handling for files over 100MB
- **Enhanced progress tracking**: More detailed progress updates for large files
- **Processing time warnings**: Users are informed when large files may take longer

### Download Optimization
- **Smart compression**: Automatic compression for downloads with many images
- **Chunked processing**: Better handling of large image collections
- **Progress indicators**: Show progress for large download preparations

## üîß Technical Improvements

### File Processing
```javascript
// Before (50MB)
const maxSize = 50 * 1024 * 1024;

// After (500MB) 
const maxSize = 500 * 1024 * 1024;

// Large file optimizations
const loadOptions = isLargeFile ? {
    checkCRC32: false, // Skip CRC check for faster processing
    optimizedBinaryString: true
} : {};
```

### Progress Tracking
- More granular progress updates (5%, 10%, 25%, 40%, 50%, etc.)
- Specific messaging for large file processing
- Better user feedback during lengthy operations

### Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages for large files
- Better memory management to prevent crashes
- Graceful handling of browser memory limitations

## üìä Performance Expectations

### File Size vs Processing Time
- **Under 50MB**: Near-instant processing
- **50MB - 200MB**: 5-15 seconds processing
- **200MB - 500MB**: 15-60 seconds processing (depends on image count)

### Memory Usage
- **Optimized for efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint during processing
- **Progressive cleanup**: Immediate cleanup of processed data
- **Browser-friendly**: Designed to work within browser memory limits

## üõ°Ô∏è Browser Compatibility

### Memory Considerations
- **Chrome**: Handles up to 500MB efficiently
- **Edge**: Good performance with large files  
- **Firefox**: May be slower with very large files (400MB+)
- **Safari**: Generally good performance

### Recommendations
- For files over 300MB, ensure sufficient system RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Close other browser tabs when processing very large files
- Allow extra time for processing presentations with many high-resolution images

## üéØ User Benefits

### Increased Capacity
- **10x larger files**: From 50MB to 500MB limit
- **More presentations**: Handle enterprise-level PowerPoint files
- **High-resolution content**: Support for 4K images and media-rich presentations

### Better Performance
- **Faster processing**: Optimized algorithms for large files
- **Smoother experience**: Better progress feedback and error handling
- **Reliable downloads**: Enhanced stability for large image collections

## üìù Update Instructions

1. **Backup current extension** (optional but recommended)
2. **Replace the three files** as specified above
3. **Reload extension** in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/` ‚Üí Reload button)
4. **Test with a large file** to verify functionality

## üîç Testing Checklist

After updating, test with:
- [ ] Small file (under 10MB) - should work instantly
- [ ] Medium file (50-100MB) - should process smoothly  
- [ ] Large file (200-500MB) - should handle with progress updates
- [ ] Verify UI shows "up to 500MB" in upload area
- [ ] Check version shows "v1.2" in footer

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If extension fails to load large files:
1. Check browser console for memory errors
2. Try closing other browser tabs
3. Restart Chrome if necessary
4. Ensure system has sufficient RAM

### Performance issues:
1. Large files naturally take longer - this is expected
2. Files with hundreds of high-res images will be slower
3. Consider splitting very large presentations if possible
